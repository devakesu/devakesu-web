# Analytics Feature Toggle
# Set to 'true' to enable client-side Analytics component and automatic page view tracking.
# When disabled, the Analytics component is not rendered, avoiding unnecessary API requests.
# Even when enabled, analytics only works if GA_MEASUREMENT_ID and GA_API_SECRET are configured.

# Client IP Detection
# The analytics API uses a priority-ordered approach to extract client IPs from headers:
# 1. cf-connecting-ip (Cloudflare CDN)
# 2. x-real-ip (nginx/Apache reverse proxy)
# 3. x-forwarded-for (various proxies/load balancers)
#
# PRODUCTION: Ensure your reverse proxy/CDN sets one of these headers and strips/overwrites
# any client-provided values to prevent IP spoofing.
#
# DEVELOPMENT: Set TEST_CLIENT_IP to simulate a specific client IP for testing rate limiting,
# geolocation, and other IP-based features (e.g., TEST_CLIENT_IP=203.0.113.45).
# If not set, defaults to 127.0.0.1 in development mode.
