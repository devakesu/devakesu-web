# Proxy / IP handling
# Whether to trust X-Forwarded-* headers from a reverse proxy when determining client IPs.
# This setting is REQUIRED for proper rate limiting and analytics IP tracking in production.
#
# Set to "true" if:
#   - Your app is behind a trusted reverse proxy (nginx, Cloudflare, Vercel, etc.)
#   - The proxy sanitizes/overwrites X-Forwarded-For headers
#
# Set to "false" or omit if:
#   - Your app is directly exposed to the internet without a proxy
#
# IMPORTANT: When TRUST_PROXY is false/unset on self-hosted deployments, request.ip
# may be undefined, causing all clients to share a single rate-limit bucket. This can
# result in false-positive 429 errors for legitimate traffic. Always set this to "true"
# when behind a reverse proxy.
# TRUST_PROXY=false
