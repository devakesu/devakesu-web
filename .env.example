# Proxy / IP handling
# Whether to trust X-Forwarded-* headers from a reverse proxy when determining client IPs.
#
# Set to "true" when:
#   - Your app is behind a trusted reverse proxy (nginx, Cloudflare, etc.)
#   - The proxy sanitizes/overwrites X-Forwarded-For headers
#   - On self-hosted setups where request.ip is unavailable
#
# Set to "false" or omit when:
#   - Your app is directly exposed to the internet without a proxy
#   - To prevent clients from spoofing X-Forwarded-For/X-Real-IP headers
#
# NOTE: Rate limiting can work without TRUST_PROXY on platforms (e.g., Vercel, Netlify)
# where request.ip is populated. However, on self-hosted deployments without TRUST_PROXY,
# request.ip may be undefined, causing all clients to share a single rate-limit bucket
# and potentially triggering false-positive 429 errors.
# TRUST_PROXY=false
